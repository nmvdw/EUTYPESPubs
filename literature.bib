	Abstract = {Set-theoretic paradoxes have made all-inclusive self-referential Foundational Theories almost a taboo. The few daring attempts in the literature to break this taboo avoid paradoxes by restricting the class of formul{\ae} allowed in Cantor's na{\"\i}ve Comprehension Principle. A different, more intensional approach was taken by Fitch, reformulated by Prawitz, by restricting, instead, the shape of deductions, namely allowing only normal(izable) deductions. The resulting theory is quite powerful, and consistent by design. However, modus ponens and Scotus ex contradictione quodlibet principles fail. We discuss Fitch-Prawitz Set Theory ({\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathsf {\{}FP{\}}{\$}{\$}) and implement it in a Logical Framework with so-called locked types, thereby providing a ``Computer-assisted Cantor's Paradise'': an interactive framework that, unlike the familiar Coq and Agda, is closer to the familiar informal way of doing mathematics by delaying and consolidating the required normality tests. We prove a Fixed Point Theorem, whereby all partial recursive functions are definable in {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathsf {\{}FP{\}}{\$}{\$}. We establish an intriguing connection between an extension of {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathsf {\{}FP{\}}{\$}{\$}and the Theory of Hyperuniverses: the bisimilarity quotient of the coalgebra of closed terms of {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathsf {\{}FP{\}}{\$}{\$}satisfies the Comprehension Principle for Hyperuniverses.},

@article{schrijverscochisimplicits,
	Abstract = {Implicit Progamming (IP) mechanisms infer values by type-directed
	resolution, making programs more compact and easier to read.
	Examples of IP mechanisms include Haskell's type classes, Scala's
	implicits, Agda's instance arguments, Coq's type classes, and Rust's
	traits.  The design of IP mechanisms has led to heated debate:
	proponents of one school argue for the desirability of strong
	reasoning properties; while proponents of another
	school argue for the power and flexibility of local scoping or
	overlapping instances.  The current state of affairs seems to indicate that
	the two goals are at odds with one another and cannot easily be
	reconciled.
	
	This paper presents COCHIS, the Calculus Of CoHerent ImplicitS,
	an improved variant of the implicit calculus that offers flexibility
	while preserving two key properties: coherence and stability of type substitutions. COCHIS supports
	polymorphism, local scoping,
	overlapping instances, first-class instances, and higher-order
	rules, while remaining type safe, coherent and stable under type substitution.
	
	We introduce a logical formulation of how to resolve implicits, which is simple
	but ambiguous and incoherent, and a second formulation, which is less simple
	but unambiguous, coherent and stable. Every resolution
	of the second formulation is also a resolution of the first, but not
	conversely. Parts of the second formulation bear a close resemblance
	to a standard technique for proof search called focusing. Moreover,
	key for its coherence is a rigorous enforcement of determinism.},
